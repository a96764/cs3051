<div class="courier"><p>Breatharianism is the belief that it is possible for a person to live by only consuming air. Breatharians claim that food (and sometimes water) is not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by prana, the vital life force in Hinduism.According to Ayurveda, air is one of the main sources of prana, and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight and air alone. </p></div>
